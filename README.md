<h1><strong>Monthly Budget Calculator</strong></h1>

This is a Webapp for calculating your monthly budget (income and expense). 
Inspired by <a href = "https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann">Jonas Schmedtmann's</a> udemy course on Javascript. 

This was a very crucial course where I got to learn a lot about how Javascript works behind the scenes; including the prototype chain,
promises and asynchronous JS, 
I also learnt modern JS project setups like NPM, babel and webpack.
